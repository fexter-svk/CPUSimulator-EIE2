# MIPS1-EIE2

There were two C++ deliverables for this coursework:
	1	Create a MIPS software simulator with 53 instructions
	2	Develop a test suite for our MIPS simulator
The aims were, to solidify our understanding of how an instruction processor actually functions. Understand the importance of having good specifications, in terms of functionality, APIs, and requirements and skills in coding from scratch.
